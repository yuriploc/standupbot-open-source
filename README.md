## Standup-Bot

#### Automated Standups for Slack Channels

Messaging tools like Slack changed our work world. Standup changed our meetings. Standup Bot keeps us accountable, tracks our goals, and got us to post our successes, plans, and upcoming challenges. We love it so much and we think you will too, so we're releasing it Open-Source.


### Slack Setup:
  * Create a new Bot in Slack if you don't have one
    * Visit `https://your-team.slack.com/services/new/bot`
  * Invite the Bot you created to all Slack Channels you want to use
    * `/invite @your_bot`
  * Add a slash command integration (It allows to start the Standup typing /standup in Slack)
    * Visit `https://your-team.slack.com/services/new/slash-commands`
      * Set `/standup` as the command.
      * Set `http://your-app.herokuapp.com/api/standups/start?format=text` as the url.
      * Set `GET` as the method.

#### Local Setup (After Slack Setup):
  * Clone the repository
    * `git clone git@github.com:sofetch/slack-standup-bot.git`

  * Start a local server and then visit the Settings page
    * `rails s`
    * Visit `http://localhost:3000/settings`  Populate all the inputs.
  * Run the mailcatcher server (It allows to see the emails, for that visit http://localhost:1080)
    * `mailcatcher`
  * Run the Delayed Job process
    * `rake jobs:work`
  * Now you have everythig ready to start your first Standup
    * Visit `http://localhost:3000/api/standups/start?channel_name=YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME`.

#### Heroku Setup (After Slack Setup):
  * Clone the repository
    * `git clone git@github.com:sofetch/slack-standup-bot.git`
  * Associate your Heroku app and then push the master branch into Heroku
    * `heroku git:remote -a heroku-app-name`
    * `git push heroku master`
  * Run the Migrations
    * `heroku run rake db:migrate`
  * Add a new worker to your app (If you don't have one running yet)
    * `heroku ps:scale worker=1`
  * Configure an SMTP server to deliver the emails
    * `heroku config:set MAILER_ADDRESS=your-smtp-domain.com`
    * `heroku config:set MAILER_PORT=587`
    * `heroku config:set MAILER_USERNAME=your-email@domain.com`
    * `heroku config:set MAILER_PASSWORD=your-password`
    * `heroku config:set MAILER_DOMAIN=your-domain.com`
